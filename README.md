# Pancreatic-Cancer-Diagnosis-Classification-Model
Using an XGBoost classification model to diagnose pancreatic cancer within patients based off of urinary biomarker data.
Pancreatic cancer has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10%, classifying it as one of the deadly forms of cancer in the United States. When detected at an early stage, viable treatments are considerably less invasive and significantly more effective, improving patient survival rate as well as quality of life. However, early detection remains a major clinical challenge due to the nature of the disease. Pancreatic cancer often produces nonspecific symptoms, or no symptoms whatsoever, therefore frequently going undiagnosed until the disease has progressed beyond curative stages. 

In this study, we trained a machine learning classification model on urinary biomarker data from three groups of patients; Healthy controls, patients with non-cancerous pancreatic conditions, and cancer patients. The data is from a study published in PLOS medicine in 2020, by Silvana Debernardi and colleagues. The data contains 590 samples of patients with varying ages and sexes. It contains urinary data which tracks six biomarkers; CA 19-9 Plasma, creatinine, LYVE1, REG1B, TFF1, and REG1A. These biomarkers have been shown to exhibit differential expression across disease states, making them promising candidates for noninvasive pancreatic cancer screening.
